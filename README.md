# CrowdMovmentSimulation
  Simple real-time agent based simulation of crowd movment.
  
 ## Implemented models:
  * Discrete preprocessed shorthets path agent movement
  * Discrete gradient based agent movement

## What do you need?
  * System supporting OpenGL (Almost any now a days)
  * Python interpreter 

## Getting Started
  1.Clone repository to youre machine ' git clone repository_url ' 
  
  2.Install required python packages
  
  3.You should be ready to go now! run main.py from projrct root

## Project Goal
  Goal of the project was to showcase and test diffrent methods of crowd simulation. We wanted to implement few diffrent methods compere one to anpther and at the end compere the simulation with real world crowd behaviour. 

## Result
  * For now there are two diffrent discrete simulation methds implemented, presenting difffent aprouch to the subject.
  * Both methods are really qucik. 
  * Gradient based model gave much more belivble results as far as the agent bhaviur goes. 
  * Worth noting is that model paramters have a huge impact on simulation results.

## Future
  Project is in constatant development.
  We plan to:
  * Do more testing with diffrent parameters
  * Improve the presentation ascpect of simulation
  * Opitmize simulations and visulisation speed
  * Add GUI with tools for easier testing
  * Add map creator
  * Add diffrent simulation models (We are specially intrested in adding a contiunues model)
  
### Built Using
